1. Problem Statement :

Retailers on Qwipoâ€™s B2B marketplace face significant challenges in product discovery, repetitive purchase behavior, and stagnant order values.

Poor Product Discovery â†’ Retailers miss 60%+ of relevant products.

Repetitive Purchase Patterns â†’ Limits cross-selling and upselling opportunities.

Stagnant Order Values (AOV) â†’ Growth has plateaued.

Low Customer Retention â†’ 35% of retailers become inactive within 6 months.

2. Detailed Proposal & Prototype Plan

We propose to build an AI-Powered Product Recommendation System for Qwipoâ€™s B2B marketplace to:

Improve product discovery through smart search and personalized suggestions.

Increase Average Order Value (AOV) by 15â€“20% through intelligent recommendations.

Enhance repeat purchase rate by 25% by analyzing buying patterns.

Provide real-time updates (order tracking, delivery status) for a seamless experience.

Prototype Flow (Qwipo B2B Journey):

Discovery â†’ NLP-based smart search for suppliers/products.

AI Recommendations â†’ Collaborative + Content-based + Hybrid filtering.

Evaluation â†’ Compare with current suppliers, check reviews.

Smart Cart â†’ Add cross-sell & bulk discount suggestions.

Payment â†’ Secure JWT authentication & confirmation.
